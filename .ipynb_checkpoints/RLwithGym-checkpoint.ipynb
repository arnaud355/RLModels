The algorithm iterates/repeats until V[s] is not (significantly) improving anymore. The Optimal policy (Ï€*) is then to take every time the action to go state with the highest value. This value iteration algorithm is an example of what is referred to as dynamic programming (DP) in literature.

For understanding, let's simplify the problem that it needs to go to a certain drop-off position to get a reward. So random moves get no rewards but by luck (brute force enough tries) the state/action is found where a reward is given. So next game the immediate actions preceding this state/action will direct toward it by use of the Q-Matrix. The next iteration the actions before that, etc, etc. In other words, it solves \"the puzzle\" backwards from end-result (drop-off passenger) towards steps to be taken to get there in a iterative fashion.\n",
